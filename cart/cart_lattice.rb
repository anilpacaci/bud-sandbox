# The CartLattice represents the state of an in-progress or checked-out shopping
# cart. The cart can hold two kinds of items: add/remove operations, and
# checkout operations. Both kinds of operations are identified with a unique ID;
# internally, the set of items is represented as a map from ID to value. Each
# value in the map is a pair: [op_type, op_val]. op_type is either ACTION_OP or
# CHECKOUT_OP.
#
# For ACTION_OPs, the value is a nested pair: [item_id, mult], where mult is the
# incremental change to the number of item_id's in the cart (positive or
# negative).
#
# For CHECKOUT_OPs, the value is a single number, lbound. This identifies the
# smallest ID number that must be in the cart for it to be complete; we also
# assume that carts are intended to be "dense" -- that is, that a complete cart
# includes exactly the operations with IDs from lbound to the CHECKOUT_OP's
# ID. Naturally, a given cart can only have a single CHECKOUT_OP.
#
# If a cart contains "illegal" messages (those with IDs before the lbound or
# after the checkout message's ID), we raise an error. We could instead
# ignore/drop such messages; this would still yield a convergent result. We also
# raise an error if multiple checkout messages are merged into a single cart;
# this is naturally a non-confluent situation, so we need to raise an error.
#
# Why bother with a custom lattice to represent the cart state? The point is
# that checkout becomes a monotonic operation, because each replica of the cart
# can decide when it is "sealed" independently (and consistently!).
